    <p>Dinner Decision helps you and your friends, family, or coworkers come to an agreement on where you 
       should go to dinner (or lunch or breakfast).  </p>
    <p>
        Start by searching for nearby restaurants or entering
        your own list of restaurants.  Then, each person will be asked in turn to vote on the restaurants.
